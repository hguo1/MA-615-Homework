$~~$Modern Bayesian practice uses various strategies to construct an appropriate “prior” g.$g(\mu )$in the absence of prior experience, leaving many statisticians unconvinced by the resulting Bayesian inferences. Our second example illustrates the difficulty.

**Table 3.1** Scores from two tests taken by 22 students, mechanics and vectors.

Table 3.1 shows the scores on two tests, mechanics and vectors, achieved by $n = 22$ students. The sample correlation coefficient between the two scores is $\hat{}\theta = 0.498$, 

<br><br>$\hat{}\theta =\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{22}{(m_i - \overline{m})((v_i - \overline{v}))}}{[\sum_{i=1}^{22}{(m_i - \overline{m})^2(v_i - \overline{v})^2}]^{1/2}}$


     
with m and v short for mechanics and vectors, $\overline{m}$ and  $\overline{v}$ their aver- ages.
